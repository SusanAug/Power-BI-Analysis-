# Power BI Analysis for Nursing Home Quality and Staffing

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI report designed to analyze and visualize various aspects of nursing home quality and staffing. The analysis is based on U.S. data, including certified beds, health deficiencies, ratings, and staffing hours by health.

The dataset provides valuable insights into:

- **Nursing Home Operations**: Information on ownership type, certified beds, legal business name, and continuing care retirement community status.
- **Ratings and Scores**: Ratings and scores associated with quality measures, staffing levels, and other factors in the Five-Star Rating System.
- **Staffing and Quality Metrics**: Analysis of Registered Nurse (RN) staffing ratings, health inspection ratings, and other quality measure ratings.
- **Other Important Metrics**: Includes details on payment denials, automatic sprinkler systems in required areas, and footnotes clarifying findings.

This data allows users to compare facilities by operational details and ratings to make well-informed decisions regarding long-term care facilities.
